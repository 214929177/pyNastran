     - non-vectorized OP2 option has being removed
   - Matrix support
   - Pandas DataFrame support for use in the Jupyter/iPython Notebook
 - GUI
   - nodal and centroidal results supported at the same time
   - deflection plot support

## pyNastran v0.7.2 has been Released (4/25/2015)

[Download pyNastran v0.7] (https://github.com/SteveDoyle2/pyNastran/releases)

This is a bug fix release.

## pyNastran v0.7.1 has been Released (4/17/2015)

Highlights:
 * OP2
   * superelement support
   * vectorized support (uses much less memory; Element Forces not vectorized yet)
   * additional results (e.g. grid point weight, eigenvalues)
   * `PARAM,POST,-2` support
   * catching of most FATAL errors without needing to read the F06
 * F06
   * removed
 * BDF
   * 238 BDF cards
   * large field format and double precision writing
 * GUI
   * much improved GUI with transient support (real only), a results sidebar, logging, and scripting support
 * Other
   * additional readers/converters to/from various other formats (e.g. STL, Cart3d, Panair) as well as GUI support
   * Python 2/3 support with a single code base
   * autogenerated online documentation for pyNastran using [readthedocs](https://rwww.readthedocs.org) and [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/)

Most op2 object were changed in order to eliminate errors, and be more consistent.  For example, `plateStress` has been replaced by `ctria3_stress`, `cquad4_stress`, `ctria6_stress`, etc.  Also, plate centroids now have a `node_id` of `0`.  This greatly simplifies F06 writing and vectorized data extraction.

### GUI (v0.7 pre-release; 12/2014)
The download page will now be located at [Sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pynastran/files/?source=navbar).  The much improved dev version of the [GUI](https://github.com/SteveDoyle2/pynastran/wiki/GUI) is located there.

### Version 0.6.1 has been released (6/2013)
**Version 0.6** improves BDF reading.  The reader is more robust and also requires proper BDF field formatting (e.g. a integer field can't be a float).  Additionally, cards also have a comment() method.

Marcin GÄ…siorek participated in the latest pyNastran under the European Space Agency's (ESA) "Summer of Code In Space" [SOCIS](http://sophia.estec.esa.int/socis2012/?q=node/13) program.  The program provides a stipend to students to work on open-source projects.
He did a great job of simplifying code and creating nicer documentation.

## Additional Info

If anyone makes any specific requests I'll try to incorporate them.  They need to be specific, such as read these cards from the BDF, read these results from this OP2, or write these results to an OP2.  <b>Any sample problems that you have (to test the software with) would be appreciated.  I need small examples that are comprehensive that I can add as demo problems.</b>
