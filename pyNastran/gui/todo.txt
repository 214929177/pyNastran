---DONE---

PyQt4 unique (PySide is broken)
===============================
 - logger

 - buttons/pulldowns
   - implicit pulldown for formats
   - zoom/rotate/snap to axis
   - screenshot
   - auto-reload
   - results sidebar

 - auto-reload button.  Useful for:
    - modifying Panair file
    - dynamically updating files
    - incrementing files for Usm3d (e.g. running a job and want to watch the
      flow develop without having to click load_results)

 - formats
   - cart3d input/output
   - nastran input/output
   - lawgs input
   - panair input
   - usm3d volume (postgrid) and results (.flo)
   - tetgen input
   - S/HABP input
   - Panair output

 - legend menu to edit properties for:
   - title
   - min value
   - max value
   - data format (%f, %e, %g, %i, %.4f)
   - red to blue; blue to red
   - TODO: continuous to discrete (doesn't work)
   - TODO: doesn't save results
   - can't move legend
     - horizontal/veterical
     - TODO: can't explicitly place it
   - TODO: can't show/hide legend
   - TODO: Cancel button doesn't go to original settings if you click apply
     - TODO: should maybe remove the OK button and rename Cancel to Close

 - global axis
   - hide support
   - additional Nastran coordinate systems supported using a script

 - minor features
   - default filename for pictures
   - pretty window title that tells you your "format - infile - outfile"
     - TODO: outfile is incorrect listed if you load a new geometry

 - zoom/rotate/snap buttons
 - command line
   - loading of geometry/results from command line
   - python scripting
   - edges
   - nodal or centroidal
      - TODO: remove option

 - picking
   - cell/node picking based on result type
   - kind of a hackish picking method
   - no nodal/centroidal position picking (e.g. get (x, y, z), not just x or y or z)

 - both nodal/centroidal work regardless of self.is_centroidal/self.is_nodal
   - TODO: cart3d only

 - results sidebar
   - data is put in the same order as the cycleResults capability (Control+L)
   - TODO: does multiple static nastran subcases work?
     - TODO: it should be put into a nested tree.  It's not.
       - is this still true?


----------------------------------------------------
---Half Finished---
 - Groups
   - need to figure out how to show/hide elements from an actor
 - Python console
   - syntax highlighting
   - font should be courier new or something similar
   - button layout

----------------------------------------------------
---Format Specific---

Nastran
=======
 - load geometry -> .bdf/nas/dat
   - shows CAERO panels
   - change between sub-element and element using dynamic menu
   - display additional coordinate system IDs

 - load results -> op2/f06
   - SOL 101
     - (nodal/centroidal) stress
     - (nodal) displacement, velocity, acceleration, spcForces, mpcForces, temperatures
   - Stress
     - rodStress, barStress, beamStress, plateStress, solidStress, compositePlateStress (centroidal only)
 - transient-style results (no complex data)

 - TODO: rotate loads based on local coordinate system
   - displacement (e.g. force, displacement, velocity)
   - stress (y/z vs. hoop)

 - TODO: multiple op2 files
 - TODO: show/hide elements based on picking
 - TODO: different nodal averaging methods (e.g.derive/avg, avg/derive)
 - TODO: interface loads
 - TODO: show/hide nodes/elements based on element ID for:
 - TODO: data label for CAERO cards
   - as a element numbr
   - as a color (e.g. element ID for the CAERO card)

Cart3d
======
 - load geometry -> tri/triq
   - nodal -> eid
   - centroidal -> nid

 - results
   - nodal/centroidal -> Mach, Cp, rho, rhoU, rhoV, rhoW, rhoE, U, V, W, E
 - TODO: show/hide elements based on picking

Panair
======
 - load geometry -> inp
   - centroidal -> patch number, area x/y/z centroid location
   - nodal -> x/y/z node location
 - supports auto-reload of geometry
 - load results -> agps
   - nodal/centroidal - > Cp
 - TODO: show/hide panels based on menu/picking

LaWGS
=====
 - load geometry -> wgs
 - TODO: Coordinate System

Tetgen
======
 - load geometry -> smesh
 - TODO: Coordinate System

STL
===
 - load geometry -> STL
 - Coordinate System

SHABP
=====
 - geometry (mk5/geo/inp)
   - location, patch number, component, impact, shadow
 - TODO: full trailer parsing
 - TODO: results parsing
 - TODO: show/hide panels based on menu/picking

Usm3d
=====
 - load geometry -> cogsg/front
 - load results -> flo, .aux.flo
   - old results not cleared out if loading both flo & aux.flo, so be careful
 - supports auto-reload of geometry and guesses for the latest result file

 - dynamic mapbc/bc file loading when input file loaded (if available)
 - dynamic flo output file loading on input
   - model_%i.flo will be found on load_geometry; where %i is the biggest number
     - supports autoreload
   - specific results file can be loaded with load results
 - TODO: Coordinate System (???)

#-------------------------
#BUGS

Qt
=======
- cycling doesn't print out the COMMAND it used
- probable bug in caclulation of iCase during cycling
- results selector window doesn't update on cycling
- loading a new geometry over a result doesn't overwrite the old name
- legend cancel doesn't return to baseline state (should it?)
- self.cycleResults('resultName') doesn't return correct result

nastran
=======
- single results (e.g. pid) can't have their legends edited
  - is this still true?
- the Isat model seems to have something wrong with the Pid
  - is this still true?
- elements with pid=0 corresponds to:
  - CONROD
  - CELAS2/4
  - buggy cards

panair
=======

cart3d
=======

shabp
=======
- trailer doesn't always parse properly

plot3d
=======
- doesn't work at all


----------------------------------------------------
---NOT DONE---
 - make vector results work
 - marker plots (arrows) & scale
 - displacement plots & scale
 - usm3d surface/boundary layer/incomplete volume
 - load file from * with a specific file type
 - zoom/rotate/snap hotkeys
 - unbreak hotkeys (p, r, ???)
 - explcit pulldown for formats
