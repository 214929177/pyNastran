---DONE---

PyQt4 unique (PySide is broken)
===============================
 - logger

 - buttons/pulldowns
   - implicit pulldown for formats
   - zoom/rotate/snap to axis
   - screenshot
   - auto-reload
   - results sidebar

 - auto-reload button.  Useful for:
    - modifying Panair file
    - dynamically updating files
    - incrementing files for Usm3d (e.g. running a job and want to watch the
      flow develop without having to click load_results)

 - formats
   - cart3d input/output
   - nastran input/output
   - lawgs input
   - panair input/output
   - usm3d volume (postgrid) and results (.flo)
   - tetgen input
   - S/HABP input
   - OpenVSP adb input/output (remove this...)
   - fast
   - ugrid
   - surf
   - csv/txt elemental/nodal results for all formats
   - csv point loading with -u for all formats (multiple files allowed)

 - legend menu to edit properties for:
   - title
   - min value
   - max value
   - data format (%f, %e, %g, %i, %.4f)
   - red to blue; blue to red
   - TODO: continuous to discrete (doesn't work)
   - TODO: doesn't save results
   - can't move legend
     - horizontal/veterical
     - TODO: can't explicitly place it
   - show/hide legend
   - TODO: Cancel button doesn't go to original settings if you click apply
     - TODO: should maybe remove the OK button and rename Cancel to Close

 - secondary actors menu
   - actor selection
     - color
     - point size
     - line size
     - show/hide
   - selective editing based on representation

 - focal point picking (e.g. clipping)
   - "f" key
   - zoom out far, press f to disable clipping
   - zoom in to desired view distance and press f  to 
     - cart3d can clip through bounding box to pick nodes/elements
       that are obscured

 - global axis
   - hide support
   - additional Nastran coordinate systems supported using a script

 - minor features
   - default filename for pictures
   - pretty window title that tells you your "format - infile - outfile"
     - TODO: outfile is incorrect listed if you load a new geometry

 - zoom/rotate/snap buttons
 - command line
   - loading of geometry/results from command line
   - python scripting
   - edges
   - disable HTML output (useful for when PyQt is buggy)

 - picking
   - cell/node picking based on result type
   - kind of a hackish picking method
   - no nodal/centroidal position picking (e.g. get (x, y, z), not just x or y or z)

 - both nodal/centroidal work regardless of self.is_centroidal/self.is_nodal

 - results sidebar
   - data is put in a nested tree and cycleResults works (Control+L)
   - multiple nastran subcases
   - load in secondary CSV results

   - need to figure out how to show/hide elements from an actor
 - Python console

   - TODO: font should be courier new or something similar
   - TODO: button layout

   - Stress
     - rodStress, barStress, beamStress, plateStress, solidStress, compositePlateStress (centroidal only)
   - Force
     - rodForce

   - TODO: stress (y/z vs. hoop)

 - multiple op2 files
 - TODO: show/hide elements based on picking
 - TODO: different nodal averaging methods (e.g.derive/avg, avg/derive)
 - TODO: interface loads
 - TODO: show/hide nodes/elements based on element ID for:
 - TODO: data label for CAERO cards
   - as a element numbr
   - as a color (e.g. element ID for the CAERO card)
 - secondary actors
   - wireframes/surfaces - CAEROx panels; CAEROx subpanels; CAEROx flaps
   - points - SPC; MPC; SUPORT1; CONM2
   - lines - bars orientation

Cart3d
======
 - load geometry -> tri/triq
   - nodal -> eid
   - centroidal -> nid, NormalX, NormalY, NormalZ

   - centroidal -> Rho, XVelocity, YVelocity, ZVelocity, Pressure
 - results
   - nodal -> Mach, Cp, rho, rhoU, rhoV, rhoW, rhoE, U, V, W, E
   - NOTE: centroidal main results removed becase nodal & centroidal
           are now supported, so there's no need to see results

 - load geometry

#BUGS

Qt
=======
- cycling doesn't print out the COMMAND it used
- probable bug in caclulation of iCase during cycling
- results selector window doesn't update on cycling
- loading a new geometry over a result doesn't overwrite the old name
- legend cancel doesn't return to baseline state (should it?)
- self.cycle_results('resultName') doesn't return correct result

nastran
=======
- single results (e.g. pid) can't have their legends edited
  - is this still true?
- the Isat model seems to have something wrong with the Pid
  - is this still true?
- elements with pid=0 corresponds to:
  - CONROD
  - CELAS2/4
  - buggy cards

panair
=======

cart3d
=======

shabp
=======
- trailer doesn't always parse properly

plot3d
=======
- doesn't work at all

tecplot
=======
- likely issue with various solid elements (inside out)
